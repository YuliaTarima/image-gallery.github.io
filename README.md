# JavaScript Array Gallery Capstone Project

## Project Overview
Create an interactive image gallery web application that manages a collection of images using JavaScript arrays. Students will demonstrate their ability to manipulate arrays, modify the DOM dynamically, and handle user events.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

#### Array Management
- Store image information (URL, title, description) in an array
- Add new images to the array
- Remove images from the array
- Update existing image information

#### DOM Manipulation
- Display the image collection on the webpage
- Update the display when the array changes
- Create new elements dynamically
- Remove elements from the DOM

#### Event Handling
- Handle form submissions to add new images
- Implement click events for image selection
- Add delete functionality via button clicks

### User Interface
- A form to add new images (URL input, title, and optional description)
- A gallery display showing all images in the array
- Delete buttons on each image card
- A counter showing the total number of images

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
- Create a form with fields for image URL, title, and description
- Include a submission button
- Create a imgContainer `div` where the gallery will be displayed
- Add a counter element to show the total number of images

### JavaScript Requirements

#### Array Operations
- Create an array to store image objects
- Implement functions to add, remove, and update array items
- Validate inputs before adding to array

#### DOM Functions
- Write functions to create image cards in the DOM
- Update the gallery display when the array changes
- Implement functions to clear and rebuild the gallery

#### Event Handlers
- Create event listeners for form submission
- Add event handlers for delete buttons
- Handle image selection events

## Evaluation Criteria
Students will be evaluated on:

- Proper implementation of array methods
- Effective DOM manipulation techniques
- Correct event handler implementation
- Code organization and comments
- User interface design and usability
- Input validation
